## Context {.smaller} 

::: {.incremental}
+ Seasonality/seasonal refers to recurring patterns that occurs at specific times of the year. 
+ It has impact on the underlying and immediate factors that drives acute malnutrition (AMN). 
+ It is known that AMN has a seasonal variation, however limited evidence is available to substantiate that.  
  - Stakeholders often rely on assumptions of an AMN seasonal peak during the food security lean season.  
    - Nutrition surveys are routinely timed to coincide with the lean season each year.

    Hagaa  :7, 10
    Deyr   :10, 12
```

+ It is generally assumed that AMN in Somalia peaks from the end of the Jilaal season to the end of the Hagaa season??

## The regional literature {.smaller}

A few studies where conducted in the region using SMART survey data: 

::: {.incremental}
+ 2 studies using 15 years of SMART survey data **in African drylands** (excluding Somalia) underscored the complex relationship between AMN and acute food insecurity: 
  - AMN and food security seasons do not always align across seasons or livelihoods. 
  - Identified two AMN seasonal peaks: **April-May** and **August-September**  

+ Somalia specific analysis used 8 years FSNAU and ACF SMART surveys (2014-2021):  

  - Seasonal peak 1: **May/June (the beginning of Gu)** 
  - Seasonal peak 2: **November (mid-Deyr)** with a decline during the lean season.
  - There were variations in the patterns according to the livelihood system (pastoralist, agropastoralist and farming)

:::

## What does this analysis add? {.smaller} 

This analysis examines six years of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) admission data from treatment programs in Somalia to explore patterns in admissions, focusing on **trends and seasonality** over time.  

### Objectives  

  + **Identify and describe trend patterns**: a long-term direction or movement in the admissions that persists across the series. This represents underlying patterns in the admissions after removing short-term fluctuations. 

  + **Identify and describe the seasonal patterns**: recurring patterns that occur in a fixed and specific period every year. In this study, this refers to monthly recurring patterns over the years.

# Methods
## Data source {.smaller} 
[Somalia Nutrition Cluster's](https://response.reliefweb.int/somalia/nutrition) six years SAM admissions. 

  - The data is reported monthly at district level.

## Analysis approach {.smaller}  
::: {.incremental}
1. Explored visually through graphs to identify patterns over time
2. It was broken down into components to examine the overall monthly trend and seasonal variation
3. The average rate of change (ARC) ^[The ARC describes the average or typical rate of change (in the admissions of SAM cases in this case) over a determined time interval of interest in the time series.] was calculated to better understand the trend: 

    $ARC = \frac{\text{admission}_{f}  -  \text{admission}_{i}}{\text{time}_{f}  -  \text{time}_{i}}$


4. Data was split into livelihood systems.

::: {.incremental}
+ The magnitude of children admitted into treatment programs has increased remarkably as of the third quarter of 2021, until in 2023 (25 months) when it started to exhibit a downward trend.  

  - The average number of cases admitted during this period increased by 1,336 cases each month
:::

::: {.incremental}
## Do these seasonal patterns agree with the seasonality of food security?

+ **NO,** they do not agree with or adhere to to food security Jilaal, Gu and Hagaa’s season, as it would, theoretically, be expected, but **they do agree (to some extent) with the Deyr season**
