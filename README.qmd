#  Feature insights into Somaliaâ€™s severe acute malnutrition admissions: a  time series study (2019 - 2024)

This repository contains an R implementation of a time series study aimed at gleaning feature insights 
from Somalia's admissions data on severe acute malnutrition (SAM), and form a basis for evidence-based decision-making of the overall country nutrition information system and programming. The analysis is based on the use of monthly SAM admissions data at district level of the previous years as of January 2019 until December 2024.

::: {.callout-note}
The analysis was made possible thanks to the collaboration of the [Somalia Nutrition Cluster](https://response.reliefweb.int/somalia/nutrition).

All in all, the study seeks to: 

  + **Identify trend patterns** in the admissions of SAM cases.
  + **Identify seasonality patterns**: recurring patterns that occurs in a fixed and specific period every year.
  + **Quantify the seasonal influences on the admissions**: the extent to which different times of the year impact on the number of SAM cases admitted into the treatment program. 
  + **Explore key drivers**: identify correlations between admissions and contextual factors. This included analyzing the impact of the 2021/2022 drought on the admissions cases. 
  + **Visualize data insights**: creating intuitive plots for clearer interpretation and communication of results.

The above objectives are addressed by decomposing the time series, by applying other feature extraction techniques, and by fitting a model.
