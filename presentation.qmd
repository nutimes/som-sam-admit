## Context {.smaller} 


<br> 

::: {.incremental}
+ Seasonality/seasonal variation refers to recurring patterns at specific times of the year. 
&nbsp;
+ It has impact on the underlying and immediate factors that drives acute malnutrition (AMN). 
&nbsp;
+ It is known that AMN has a seasonal variation, however limited evidence is available to substantiate that.  
  - Stakeholders often rely on assumptions of an AMN seasonal peak during the food security lean season.  
    - Nutrition surveys are routinely timed to coincide with the lean season each year.

    Deyr   :10, 12
```

+ It is generally assumed that AMN in Somalia peaks from the end of the Jilaal season to the end of the Gu season.
:::

## The regional literature {.smaller}

A few studies where conducted in the region using SMART survey data: 

::: {.incremental}
+ 2 studies using 15 years of SMART survey data **in African drylands** (excluding Somalia) underscored the complex relationship between AMN and acute food insecurity: 
  - AMN and food security seasons do not always align across seasons or livelihoods. 
  - Identified two AMN seasonal peaks: **April-May** and **August-September**  

<br>

+ Somalia specific analysis used 8 years FSNAU and ACF SMART surveys (2014-2021):  

  - Seasonal peak 1: **May/June (the beginning of Gu)** 
  - Seasonal peak 2: **November (mid-Deyr)** with a decline during the lean season.
      - This was the highest peak observed. May/June was the second high. 
  - There were variations in the patterns according to the livelihood system (pastoralist, agropastoralist and farming)

:::

## What does this analysis add? {.smaller} 

<br> 

This analysis examines six years of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) admission data from treatment programs in Somalia to explore patterns in admissions, focusing on **trends and seasonality** over time.  

<br> 

### Objectives  

  + **Identify and describe trend patterns**: a long-term direction or movement in the admissions that persists across the series. This represents underlying patterns in the admissions after removing short-term fluctuations. 

  + **Identify and describe the seasonal patterns**: recurring patterns that occur in a fixed and specific period every year. In this study, this refers to monthly recurring patterns over the years.


# Methods
## Data source {.smaller} 

<br> 

[Somalia Nutrition Cluster's](https://response.reliefweb.int/somalia/nutrition) six years SAM admissions. 

  - The data is reported monthly at district level.

## Analysis approach {.smaller}  

<br>

::: {.incremental}
1. Explored visually through graphs to identify patterns over time
2. It was broken down into components to examine the overall monthly trend and seasonal variation
3. The average rate of change (ARC) ^[The ARC describes the average or typical rate of change (in the admissions of SAM cases in this case) over a determined time interval of interest in the time series.] was calculated to better understand the trend: 

    $ARC = \frac{\text{admission}_{f}  -  \text{admission}_{i}}{\text{time}_{f}  -  \text{time}_{i}}$


4. Data was split into livelihood systems.

# Translating the graphs into a plain AMN seasonal calendar 📅

## 
::: {.incremental}

+ Currently, the analyses parameters of the AMN go hand-in-hand with those of the IPC AFI

![](data/som-ipc-parameters.png)

+ This analysis's findings suggest that the AMN analysis parameters need to be rethought to match the times when AMN evolution changes de facto. 
    - This should be sensitive to the existing livelihood systems.

## Trend

<br> 

+ The magnitude of admissions increased remarkably as of the 3rd quarter of 2021 until 2023 (`r arc_feb2021_mar2023[[5]]` months) when it started to decrease slowly.

+ The average number of cases admitted during this period increased by `r format(round(arc_feb2021_mar2023[[6]]),big.mark=",")` cases each month.

+ The increased trend reflects the intensified program response at the time, to fit the also increased needs.
    - even after the drought has passed, the magnitude of the admissions remained excessively high, compared to years before the drought, although it shows a downward trend

::: {.callout-caution}
This suggests that the program response remained high even after. This means that in case the program becomes underfunded in a short-term, many children will be left untreated due to the scale-down of program capacity.

+ **Pastoral and agropastoral** livelihood systems: 

    - The primary peak is consistently observed in May-June;
    - Secondary peak in January, with a start in **November for the pastoral**, and in **December for the agropastoral** systems.
    - The lowest trough occurs in April in both systems.

These findings align with except for a slight deviation in the agropastoral system, where the second peak shifts from November (as identified by ?? to December in this analysis

## Seasonal variation (2/4)

+ **Riverine livelihood system**: 
    - The highest peak occurs in December-January, followed by several smaller peaks throughout the year, indicating a more fragmented seasonal pattern.
    - The pattern in the riverine differ remarkably from the other system. **It is the only system where the primary peak does not occur in May-June**

::: {.callout-note}
These patterns also diverge from Luc., et all (2024) observations, which identified the higher peak in November
:::

::: {.callout-important}
An insteresting finding is that the riverine and pastoral, are the only livelihood systems where there is a peak in March before the lower trough in April.
**Why is that??** *Question to the Nutrition Cluster members.*

## Seasonal variation (3/4)

+ **Urban/IDPs livelihood system**: 
    - Exhibits a unique and intriguing pattern compared to the others.
    - While the highest peak consistently occurs in May-June, similar to most other systems (except the riverine), the admissions in January notably align with the trend line (baseline) every year; 
    - From February onward, the admissions begin a continuous decline, reaching the common lowest trough in April.

::: {.callout-note}
This distinct pattern could not be compared to previous studies, as they did not include a specific livelihood category for urban areas and/or IDPs.
:::

## 


+ The discrepancies in the months in findings may be related to the fact that the survey data used were collected over a specific time period, while the admissions are reported monthly over the years. 

<br>

+ This also explains the absence of a trough in April in the author's study, as all surveys were undertook starting in May and then November to December.
