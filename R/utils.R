#' 
#' 
#' Average rate of change (ARC) for a continuos time series 
#' 
#' The ARC (Average Rate of Change) quantifies the typical rate of change over 
#' a specified time interval. It is calculated from the trend line and 
#' represents the rate of difference between the average occurrence of a given 
#' measurement at the end of the time series and its average occurrence at the start. 
#' This difference is divided by the total duration of the interval. 
#' The ARC is expressed in the same units as the original measurement scale, 
#' providing an interpretable rate of change.
#' 
#' @param ts A time series object of class `tsibble`.
#' 
#' @param start A basis of time that represents the start of the whole series or
#'  a point of piece of the series for which the ARC would be calculated for.
#' 
#' @param end A basis of time that represents the end point of the whole series
#' or just a piece of the series.
#' 
#' @param .for An indication on whether the ARC should be calculated for the 
#' entire time series (`"whole_ts`) or for a piece of it (`"knots"`). 
#' 
#' @returns A list of ouputs that are useful to build a narrative on the findigs.
